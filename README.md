# contact_material_experiment
The repository contains data from an experiment ("artificial vs. natural experiment") conducted in winter 2019/2020. The experiment was performed to invetigate the role of artificial contact materials in experimental use-wear studies. The two data sets in the repository result from a quantitative use-wear analysis performed in 2021. The samples analysed quantitatively are: a) all 24 samples from before and after 2000 strokes (called "analysis_before.after") and b) selected eight samples from all cycles (called "analysis_all.cylces").
